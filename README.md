## Notes

The library part of Sheikah Converter is based on [DeltaJordan's BotW-Save-Manager](https://github.com/DeltaJordan/BotW-Save-Manager).

Also, the save files used on the tests were taken from [Torphedo's BOTW-CompletedSaveFile](https://github.com/Torphedo/BOTW-CompletedSaveFile). Those were extremely useful for debugging, as Torphedo provided provided save files for both consoles.
